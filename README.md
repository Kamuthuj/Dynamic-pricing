In this dynamic pricing strategy, I aimed to maximize revenue and profitability  at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics.Using the dataset I obtained from Kaggle, I loaded it and performed data cleaning and several ETL processess. I was keen in observing features that would affect pricing and created a correlation matrix to observe the strength of different features. Features that had strong correlation inclueded ride duration, historical cost of ride, and also the number of riders and drivers.
